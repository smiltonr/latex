\begin{frame}{Simple presentation}
  With LaTeX Beamer, we can make consistently looking
  presentation.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use \texttt{beamer} class.
  \item Choose a theme.
  \item Otherwise, usual \LaTeX.
  \end{itemize}

  Use simple and direct words.

    A man of true science \ldots uses but few hard words, and
    those only when none other will answer his purpose; whereas
    the smatterer in science\ldots thinks, that by mouthing
    hard words, he proves that he understands hard things.
